# AntPack

AntPack is a toolkit for data processing, statistical inference and
machine learning for antibody sequences. It is currently in highly
active development. For installation and how to
use, see [the docs](https://antpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


### Antibody numbering

Numbering antibody sequences is an important precursor for many statistical inference /
machine learning applications. AntPack is orders of magnitude faster for numbering
antibody sequences than existing tools in the literature (e.g. ANARCI, AbRSA),
while providing >= reliability.

### Mapping antibody sequence space

We're building a set of human-interpretable machine learning models of antibody sequence space --
more on this project soon!


### Human-ness and developability

Immunogenicity is a frequent cause of failure for antibody drug candidates in clinical trials.
Avoiding such costly failures is highly desirable. As part of this package, we'll introduce
tools to help predict the likelihood of immunogenicity or other serious developability
problems (coming soon.)
