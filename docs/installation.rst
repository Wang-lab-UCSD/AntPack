Installation
================

To install it, type:::

  pip install antpack

Also see the `github repo <https://github.com/jlparkI/AntPack>`_
Starting with version 0.3, AntPack is distributed precompiled as a wheel
for most platforms. In these cases pip will install it without any need to
compile any code. In the event of any issues, antpack is still available as a
source distribution, and pip can still install
easily -- pip will automatically try to find a C++ compiler on your system and
compile from source. In the unlikely event that you encounter any issues please
contact us using the Issues page on Github (see About / Contact section on the main page).

Required dependencies are ``numpy``. These should be
automatically installed but if desired can be installed first.
Python3.7 or later is required.
