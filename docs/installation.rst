Installation
================

Starting with version 0.1.5, AntPack is available on PyPi. To install it,
type:::

  pip install antpack

Also see the `github repo <https://github.com/jlparkI/AntPack>`_
If you encounter any issues please contact us using the About / Contact
section on the main page.

Required dependencies are ``pybind11``, ``numpy``,
``biopython``, ``setuptools`` and ``wheel``. These should be
automatically installed but if desired can be installed first. To further facilitate ease of installation
we plan to move to distributing on PyPi as well.

AntPack is also available as a docker image on `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/jlparkinson1/antpack>`_.
The docker image when run will provide the output of the package unit tests.
We do not encourage the use of the docker image in general, but it is available for
users who are interested. We may discontinue support for the Docker image in
a future release.
